# Jazz Digital Squad Hackathon for Data Analytics on Sample Superstore

Excited to share our journey at the Jazz Data Hackathon! Teaming up with [Ahmad Tashfeen](https://github.com/ahmadtash7) and [Zaid Bin Usama](https://github.com/zaidbinusama), we dove into the world of data storytelling. As part of the Jazz Digital Squad, we crafted a Tableau dashboard that goes beyond mere charts and graphs; it's a narrative of "Demographics," "Sales," and "Profits," uncovering hidden insights within the data. Our goal was to extract as much meaningful information as possible while covering all facets of the dataset.

This experience was a perfect blend of challenge and creativity, urging us to transform raw numbers into compelling narratives. We're thrilled with the outcome and eagerly anticipate future challenges.
